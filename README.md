# Invoice Generator API
For those times when you just need an invoice

## About

We created a simple API at Invoiced to generate invoice PDFs on the fly. This service has been used internally by us for some time. We believe this could be helpful in your project as well. The most obvious use case to us is generating an invoice from a webhook off a SaaS billing system like Stripe.

The API only has a single endpoint that returns a PDF. We don't store any of your invoice data.

### Endpoint

``https://invoice-generator.com``

## Sample Projects

- Go: [generate invoices programmatically](https://github.com/Invoiced/go-invoice-generator-connector)
- Ruby: [generate invoices from Stripe webhooks](https://github.com/Invoiced/ruby-stripe-invoice-generator)
- Ruby: [invoices in under 5 minutes using HTTParty gem](https://gelato.io/blog/minimum-viable-ruby-api-client-with-invoiced-and-httparty)
- Node.js: [invoice-generator.js](https://github.com/Invoiced/invoice-generator.js)
- PHP: [generate invoices programmatically](https://github.com/concept-core/Invoiced)

### Invoice Fields

The `fields` object toggles the `discounts`, `tax`, and `shipping` fields. Each field can have a value of `%`, `true`, or `false`. For example to add a percent tax rate and flat shipping to your invoice you would send this:

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "tax": "%",
    "discounts": false,
    "shipping": true
  },
  "tax": 7,
  "shipping": 15
}
```

### Line Items

Line items are represented as an array of objects. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "Gizmo",
      "quantity": 10,
      "unit_cost": 99.99,
      "description": "The best gizmos there are around."
    }
    {
      "name": "Gizmo v2",
      "quantity": 5,
      "unit_cost": 199.99
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rate Limiting

The invoice-generator.com API is rate limited. With almost every use case this should not be an issue. If an API call does trigger rate limiting then we will respond with a `429` status code to let you know to try generating your invoice again later. If you frequently run into these limits then you might also consider using our paid service at [invoiced.com](https://invoiced.com).
